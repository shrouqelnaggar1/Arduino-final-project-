# Arduino-final-project-


Project description :

The main idea of the project is to make a smart gate that opens automatically when people stand in front of it, and this feature is due to the photorisitor.
When the light is blocked from it, the motor signal is sent, and the gate is opened, and also when five people enter the gate, the lid will be lit, warning that five people have entered and the gate will not open again


Objects :

1)	Electronic gate containing :
2)	photoresistor (LDR) to detect passing humans and keep trace of the count of entrees.
3)	a push button to power the system
4)	a motor to open the door
5)	an alarm gets fired (using a buzzer) that work when the total count of people inside the room exceeds five


preview :

The project is started using the push button when the light is blocked from the photo resistor, then this will be like entering a person from the gate. The number of people entering from the gate is increased until the maximum of five is reached, and then the gate will not open again.


Problems :
We should use :
1)	photoresistor (LDR) to detect passing humans and keep trace of the count of entrees.
2)	a push button to power the system
3)	a motor to open the door
4)an alarm gets fired (using a buzzer) that work when the total count of people inside the room exceeds five
